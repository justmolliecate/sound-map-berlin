Instead of abandoning the city, the Western Powers began Operation Vittles (or Berlin Airlift) where they flew in food, water, and other necessities for the West Berliners, allowing them to survive the period of time. Tempelhof closed to air traffic in 2008 and is now a public park. Events are held in the hangars on occasion and in 2015 it was designated as an emergency shelter for about 1200 refugees. </p><video width=320 height=240 controls><source src='videos/bike-1.mp4' type='video/mp4'>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>"
